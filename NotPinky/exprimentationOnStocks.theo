Note 1
Observation: Noticed if I buy at opening price within three days there will be 1% pop in price 80% of the time for blue chip stocks like goog, AMD and IBM
Possible new experiment: May be I need to select the days where there was not a pop and then train to see if there is a detectable pattern.I might need multiple stocks to prove this.

Note 2 
Observation: Noticed if I buy at opening price within three days there will be 1% pop in price 80% of the time for blue chip stocks like goog, AMD and IBM
Possible new experiment: What if I try the three days without the current day. This is because you want to make it more realistic and similar to robinhoods implementation which doesnt allow day trading
Postheory: Selecting a day outside the current day lead to a about a 10% drop in likelihood. Essentially from 80 to about 70 ish percent.
